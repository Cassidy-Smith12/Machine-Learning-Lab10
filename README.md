 Exercise 1:
 Given the following dataset: from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes that contains 442 data
 points and 10 features, build a Deep Neural Network using the MLPRegressor. Try different
 architectures with different hyperparameters. Implement at least three different architectures.

 Exercise 2:
 Given the following dataset: seeds dataset, build a Deep Neural Network using the MLP
 Classifier. Try different architectures with different hyperparameters. Implement at least three
 different architectures.
